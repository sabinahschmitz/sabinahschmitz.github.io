          James Oscar McKinsey (1889 - 1937) was born in Gamma, Missouri. He is the founder of the eponymous consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Inc.
<p></p>
Early in life, McKinsey knew poverty. He was raised in a three-room house in the Ozarks. By sheer determination he completed high school and continued his education. At Warrensburg Teachers College (now University of Central Missouri), he received training to become a teacher. 
<p></p>
McKinsey obtained his Bachelor of Pedagogy in 1912. He later studied Law at the University of Arkansas, Bookkeeping at the St. Louis University as well as Philosophy and Commerce at the University of Chicago.
<p></p>
During World War I. he was a Lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corps. His military responsibilities required him to deal with important suppliers all over the United States.
<p></p>
In 1919, McKinsey passed his Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination. From 1920 to 1921 he was a lecturer at Columbia University. In 1921, he joined the private accounting practice of George Frazer, who was Professor of Accounting at the University of Chicago.
<p></p>
In 1924, McKinsey’s interests began to shift from accounting and budgeting to managerial accounting. He published books that would be considered pioneering efforts in the respective fields.
<p></p>
In 1926, McKinsey founded McKinsey & Company with the aim of advising company management instead of just offering accounting services or clarifying tax issues. He asserted the need for continued education for future executives and foresaw the era of the “scientific man” in business. In the same year, McKinsey played a role in the establishment of The Accounting Review. 
<p></p>
In 1935 he left McKinsey & Company and joined the board of Marshall Field & Company. 
<p></p>
In 1936, he was elected chairman of the American Management Association, an organization he helped initiate.
<p></p>
McKinsey died of pneumonia in Chicago on 30 November 1937.
