James Oscar McKinsey (1889 - 1937) was born in 1889 in Gamma, Missouri.
McKinsey is the founder of his eponymous consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Inc. </br></br>
Early in life McKinsey knew poverty. By sheer determination he completed high school and continued his education.
At Warrensburg Teachers College (now University of Central Missouri), he received training to become a teacher. He taught algebra. 
He obtained his Bachelor of Pedagogy in 1912. He later studied Law at the University of Arkansas, Bookkeeping at the St. Louis University as well as Philosophy and Commerce at the University of Chicago.</br></br>
        </p>
        <p>During World War I he was a Lieutenant in the Quartermaster Corp. His military responsibilities required him to deal with important suppliers all over the United States. </br></br>
          In 1919, he passed his Certified Public Accountant (CPA) examination. From 1920 to 1921 he was a lecturer at Columbia University.
          In 1921, he joined the private accounting practice of George Frazer, who was Professor of accounting at the University of Chicago.
        </br></br>
          1924 was significant turning point in McKinsey’s career. His interests began to shift from accounting and budgeting to managerial accounting. He is credited with the first textbook in Managerial Accounting.</p>

          
          <p>In 1926, McKinsey founded McKinsey & Company with the aim of advising company managements instead of just offering accounting services or clarifying tax issues. McKinsey asserted the need for continued education for future executives and foresaw the era of the “scientific man” in business.</br>
            In the same year, McKinsey played a role in the establishment of The Accounting Review.
            In 1935 he left McKinsey and joined the board of Marshall Field & Company.
            In 1936, he was elected chairman of the American Management Association, an organization he helped initiate.
          </br></br>
            McKinsey died of pneumonia in Chicago on 30 November 1937.</p>
