      James Oscar McKinsey (June 4, 1889 – November 30, 1937) was born in Gamma, Missouri. He is the founder of the eponymous consulting firm McKinsey & Company, Inc.
      <p></p>
      McKinsey (or Mac, as he was known by friends) was the son of James Madison and Mary Elizabeth Logan McKinsey. He had a modest upbringing and was raised in a three-room house in the Ozarks. 
      <p></p>
      
      McKinsey completed his high school and continued his education at Warrensburg Teachers College (now University of Central Missouri). In 1912, he received a Bachelor of Pedagogy. He also studied Law at the University of Arkansas (1914), Bookkeeping at the St. Louis University as well as Philosophy and Commerce at the University of Chicago. In 1919, McKinsey passed his Certified Public Accountant examination. He is also credited for writing the first textbook in managerial accounting, in the same year.
      <p></p>
      During World War I. McKinsey served as a Lieutenant in the ordnance department of the Army (Quartermaster Corps). He supported the development, production, and acquisition of general supply all over the United States. From 1920 to 1921 he lectured accounting at Columbia University. In 1921, he joined the private accounting practice of George Frazer (Frazer and Torbert).
      <p></p>
      As of 1924, McKinsey’s interests began to shift from accounting and budgeting to managerial accounting. In 1925 he left the consulting firm of Professor Frazer. One year later, he founded James O. McKinsey and Company. His aim was to advise the company’s management instead of merely offering accounting services or tax advice. In doing so, he emphasized the need for continued education and life-long learning.
      <p></p>
      As a consultant McKinsey was highly successful. He was the main salesman in the company. His appearance impressed people. He was tall – 1.87m, and dressed conservatively. He hired outstanding people such as Marvin Bower and Tom Kearney to work for him. In fact, many of the men he employed were students in his classes at the University of Chicago.
      <p></p> 
      In 1930, James McKinsey married Alice Louise Anderson. They had twin sons, Robert and Richard McKinsey. 
      <p></p>
      In 1935 he left McKinsey & Company and joined the board of Marshall Field & Company. Under McKinsey’s leadership, Marshall Field reported a net income of $1,2 million (that has a relative project worth of <a href="https://measuringworth.com/dollarvaluetoday/?amount=18902&from=1935">$356 million </a> today).
      <p></p>
      Besides heading Marshall Field, he was a director of the Chicago Corporation and the Kroger Grocery and Baking Company. He also was a member of the board of trustees of the Armour Institute of Technology as well as a member of the board of managers of the Chicago Young Men’s Christian Associations, and a director of the Central Y.M.C.A. College. Other memberships included different fraternities, Golf Clubs of Chicago, and the Rookery of New York.
      <p></p>
      McKinsey died of pneumonia in Chicago on 30 November 1937.
